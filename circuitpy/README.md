# Circuit Python Code for the RFID Card Reader

The code in this directory is for the RFID card reading device. It's written
using [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/) and it runs on a Raspberry Pi
Pico with a connected RFID card reader (`RC522`). The `mfrc522` library is taken
from this guide (License?):
